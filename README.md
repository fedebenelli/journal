# journal

This little program will firstly ask for an username and password,
all your journal entries will be saved according to that username and
encrypted acording to the user's password, so make sure not to change it!

When adding an entry, use the string \'\\n' to add a new paragraph
since pressing intro will just save your input until that point
(you can still add a new entry afterwards if that happens)

When you compile your journal a \'journal.md\' file will me made,

# To-do:
1. Add a 'month subsection' to the compiled full journal, format should be '## <month>'
2. Export the full_journal as a .html file (possible with markdown library)
